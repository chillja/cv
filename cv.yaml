# about: '
#   I am a researcher and broadly study foundational topics
#   and applications in
#   <b>machine learning</b> (sometimes deep) and
#   <b>optimization</b> (sometimes convex),
#   including
#   reinforcement learning, computer vision, language,
#   statistics, and theory.
#   I am finishing a Ph.D. at <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b>
#   advised by \href{http://zicokolter.com/}{Zico Kolter}
#   and am supported by an <b>NSF graduate research fellowship.</b>
#   My dissertation is entitled
#   "Differentiable Optimization-Based Inference for Machine Learning"
#   and my <b>thesis proposal</b> is available
#   \href{https://goo.gl/MTiDrb}{here}.
#   My publications are available below and on
#   my \href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d8gdZR4AAAAJ}{Google Scholar} page.
#   <br><br>
#   My research straddles <b>applied and theoretical contributions</b>.
#   Over the past three years (since 2016) I have focused on
#   foundational contributions to the <b>NIPS, ICML, and ICLR communities</b>.
#   The core pillars of my dissertation are
#   my <b>ICML 2017</b> papers on
#   \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07152}{input-convex neural networks}
#   and
#   \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00443}{OptNet layers}.
#   My <b>NIPS 2018</b> paper uses OptNet as a foundation to
#   <b>combine model-free and model-based</b> reinforcement learning.
#   I have also worked on <b>reinforcement learning</b>
#   during an internship
#   with
#   \href{https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/}{Nando de Freitas}
#   and
#   \href{http://mdenil.com/}{Misha Denil}
#   at <b>DeepMind</b> in 2017,
#   publishing an <b>ICLR 2018</b> paper
#   \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06318}{Learning Awareness Models},
#   and on <b>combinatorial and discrete learning problems</b>
#   with \href{http://vladlen.info}{Vladlen Koltun}
#   at <b>Intel Labs</b> in 2018.
#   <br><br>
#   Before this, as an undergraduate (from 2011-2014) I focused on compilers,
#   distributed systems, mobile computing, and
#   \href{https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/49672/qnTOMS14.pdf}{Quasi-Newton Methods for Stochastic Optimization}.
#   I value important <b>societal applications</b> of my work and
#   spent the first two years of my Ph.D. (from 2014-2016)
#   working on applied machine learning and computer vision technologies
#   underlying <b>mobile and wearable cognitive assistance systems</b>
#   with
#   \href{https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/}{Mahadev Satyanarayanan},
#   publishing papers at <b>systems- and mobile-oriented</b> venues during this time.
#   <br><br>
#   I strongly believe in <b>open science, reproducible research,
#   and well-engineered projects</b>
#   and actively publish code on \href{https://github.com/bamos}{my Github profile}.
#   This led me to create
#   \href{https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/}{OpenFace} in 2016,
#   which was the first open-source deep-learning-based
#   face recognition project.
#   I <b>deeply value collaboration</b> and believe it catalyzes scientific
#   progress and have been involved as a non-primary co-author on
#   <b>~15 papers</b> over the past few years.
#   I enjoy <b>writing and teaching introductory material</b> if I see an opportunity,
#   like
#   \href{http://bamos.github.io/2016/08/09/deep-completion/}{this blog post on image completion with GANs.}
#   <br><br>
#   <b>I am on the job market.</b>
#   For at least the next decade of my career I want to stay
#   in the machine learning research community.
#   I am looking for a position that lets me continue to
#   <b>straddle foundational and applied contributions</b> to the field.
#   Please \href{http://bamos.github.io/data/cv.pdf}{get in touch}
#   if you have an opening.
